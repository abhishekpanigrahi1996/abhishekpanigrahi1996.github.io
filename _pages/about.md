I seek to solve problems that involve (a) analysis of existing Machine Learning algorithms using mathematical tools such as probability and high-dimensional geometry and (b) proposing new algorithms involving large scale optimization, which have either theoretical or interpretability guarantees.

Currently, I am a [Research Fellow](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/research-fellow-program/?#){:target="_blank"} at [Microsoft Research Lab - India](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/){:target="_blank"} where I am fortunate to work with [Dr. Harsha Vardhan Simhadri](http://harsha-simhadri.org/){:target="_blank"} and [Dr. Navin Goyal](https://dblp.uni-trier.de/pers/hd/g/Goyal:Navin){:target="_blank"} on unsupervised techniques for word embeddings and theory of convergence of neural networks. Prior to the fellowship, I attended [IIT Kharagpur](http://www.iitkgp.ac.in){:target="_blank"} where I obtained my B.Tech. in [Computer Science and Engineering](http://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/){:target="_blank"} in 2018.


I help in organizing Theory seminar at Microsoft Research India. Please get in touch if you are interested in presenting your work at MSR India.

I will be joining the [Computer Science department](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/){:target="_blank"} of [Princeton University](https://www.princeton.edu/){:target="_blank"} for my graduate studies in Fall 2020.
