I am a final-year graduate student in the [Computer Science department](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/){:target="_blank"} at [Princeton University](https://www.princeton.edu/){:target="_blank"}, advised by [Prof. Sanjeev Arora](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~arora/){:target="_blank"}. My research focuses on understanding the effect of the model architecture and optimization algorithms on the generalization behavior of deep learning models. My past works have spanned across different research directions, like neural tangent kernels, feature learning, implicit bias of optimization algorithms, skill localization in large language models, efficient pre-training, and test time adaptive architectures. 

Previously, I was a [Research Fellow](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/research-fellow-program/?#){:target="_blank"} at [Microsoft Research Lab - India](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/){:target="_blank"} where I was fortunate to work with [Dr. Harsha Vardhan Simhadri](http://harsha-simhadri.org/){:target="_blank"} and [Dr. Navin Goyal](https://dblp.uni-trier.de/pers/hd/g/Goyal:Navin){:target="_blank"} on unsupervised techniques for word embeddings and theory of optimization and generalization guarantees for neural networks. Prior to the fellowship, I attended [IIT Kharagpur](http://www.iitkgp.ac.in){:target="_blank"} where I obtained my B.Tech. in [Computer Science and Engineering](http://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/){:target="_blank"} in 2018.
