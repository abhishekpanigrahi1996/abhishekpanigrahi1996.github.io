We used a residual encoder that used output of intermediate layers of VGG-16 CNN to give color to black and white image.

A public repository of the project, with a report summarizing the project, can be found in the [Git link](https://github.com/abhishekpanigrahi1996/heuristics_colorize){:target="_blank"}.
