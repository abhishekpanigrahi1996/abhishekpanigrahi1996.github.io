I was a part of this project, that has been assigned to IIT Kharagpur and is funded by Ministry of Human Resource Development, India. I developed a Web-Service for extracting file links for Institutional Digital Repositories (IDRs).

The entire project can be found in the [Website Link](https://ndl.iitkgp.ac.in){:target="_blank"}.
