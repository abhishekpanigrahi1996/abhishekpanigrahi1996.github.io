In this paper, we develop a content-cum-user based deep learning framework DeepTagRec to recommend appropriate question tags on Stack Overflow. The proposed system learns the content representation from question title and body. Subsequently, the learnt representation from heterogeneous relationship between user and tags is fused with the content representation for the final tag prediction. On a very large-scale dataset comprising half a million question posts, DeepTagRec beats all the baselines; in particular, it significantly outperforms the best performing baseline TagCombine achieving an overall gain of 60.8% and 36.8% in precision@3 and recall@10 respectively. DeepTagRec also achieves 63% and 33.14% maximum improvement in exact-k accuracy and top-k accuracy respectively over TagCombine.
